He said the way my blue eyes shinedPut those Georgia stars to shame that nightI said, "That's a lie."Just a boy in a Chevy truckThat had a tendency of gettin' stuckOn back roads at nightAnd I was right there beside him all summer longAnd then the time we woke up to find that summer goneBut when you think Tim McGrawI hope you think my favorite songThe one we danced to all night longThe moon like a spotlight on the lakeWhen you think happinessI hope you think that little black dressThink of my head on your chestAnd my old faded blue jeansWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think of meSeptember saw a month of tearsAnd thankin' God that you weren't hereTo see me like thatBut in a box beneath my bedIs a letter that you never readFrom three summers backIt's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweetAnd lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believeWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think my favorite songThe one we danced to all night longThe moon like a spotlight on the lakeWhen you think happinessI hope you think that little black dressThink of my head on your chestAnd my old faded blue jeansWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think of meAnd I'm back for the first time since thenI'm standin' on your streetAnd there's a letter left on your doorstepAnd the first thing that you'll read is:When you think Tim McGrawI hope you think my favorite songSomeday you'll turn your radio onI hope it takes you back to that placeWhen you think happinessI hope you think that little black dressThink of my head on your chestAnd my old faded blue jeansWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think of meOh, think of meMmmmHe said the way my blue eyes shinedPut those Georgia stars to shame that nightI said, "That's a lie."State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasyI realize you love yourself more than you could ever love meSo go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy[Album version line:] That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay![Music video version line:] That's fine you won't mind if I sayBy the way...[Chorus:]I hate that stupid old pickup truckYou never let me driveYou're a redneck heartbreakWho's really bad at lyingSo watch me strike a matchOn all my wasted timeAs far as I'm concerned you'reJust another picture to burn!There's no time for tears,I'm just sitting here planning my revengeThere's nothing stopping meFrom going out with all of your best friendsAnd if you come around saying sorry to meMy daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be[Chorus]And if you're missing me,You'd better keep it to yourself'Cause coming back around hereWould be bad for your health...'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truckYou never let me driveYou're a redneck heartbreakWho's really bad at lyingSo watch me strike a matchOn all my wasted timeIn case you haven't heard,I really really hate that...[Chorus]Burn, burn, burn, baby, burnYou're just another picture to burnBaby, burn...Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't seeThat I want and I'm needing everything that we should beI'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,And she's got everything that I have to live without.Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny [radio version]Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny [CD version]That I can't even see anyone when he's with meHe says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night[Chorus:]He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitarThe only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing starHe's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I doDrew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?And there he goes, so perfectly,The kind of flawless I wish I could beShe better hold him tight, give him all her loveLook in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause[Chorus]So I drive home alone.As I turn out the lightI'll put his picture downAnd maybe get some sleep tonight.'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitarThe only one who's got enough of me to break my heartHe's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I doHe's the time taken up, but there's never enoughAnd he's all that I need to fall into.Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.I don't know what I want, so don't ask meCause I'm still trying to figure it outDon't know what's down this road, I'm just walkingTrying to see through the rain coming downEven though I'm not the only oneWho feels the way I do[Chorus:]I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I knowI'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes onOh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this worldGot the radio on, my old blue jeansAnd I'm wearing my heart on my sleeveFeeling lucky today, got the sunshineCould you tell me what more do I needAnd tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeahBut that's ok[Chorus]Maybe I'm just a girl on a missionBut I'm ready to flyI'm alone, on my own, and that's all I knowI'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes onOh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I knowOh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this worldOh I'm just a girlOh I'm just a girl, oh, oh,Oh I'm just a girlYou have a way of coming easily to meAnd when you take, you take the very best of meSo I start a fight cause I need to feel somethingAnd you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted[Chorus:]Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect dayJust walk away, no use defending words that you will never sayAnd now that I'm sitting here thinking it throughI've never been anywhere cold as youYou put up walls and paint them all a shade of grayAnd I stood there loving you and wished them all awayAnd you come away with a great little storyOf a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you[Repeat Chorus]You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for youAnd I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you(Died for you)Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect dayEvery smile you fake is so condescendingCounting all the scars you madeAnd now that I'm sitting here thinking it throughI've never been anywhere cold as youI didn't know what I would findWhen I went looking for a reason, I knowI didn't read between the linesAnd, baby, I've got nowhere to goI tried to take the road less traveled byBut nothing seems to work the first few timesAm I right?[Chorus:]So how can I ever try to be better?Nobody ever lets me inI can still see you, this ain't the best viewOn the outside looking inI've been a lot of lonely placesI've never been on the outsideYou saw me there, but never knewI would give it all up to beA part of this, a part of youAnd now it's all too late so you seeYou could've helped if you had wanted toBut no one notices until it's tooLate to do anything[Repeat Chorus]So how can I ever try to be better?Nobody ever lets me inI can still see you, this ain't the best viewOn the outside looking inI've been a lot of lonely placesI've never been on the outsideSeems the only one who doesn't see your beautyIs the face in the mirror looking back at youYou walk around here thinking you're not prettyBut that's not true, cause I know you...[Chorus:]Hold on, baby, you're losing itThe water's high, you're jumping into itAnd letting go... and no one knowsThat you cry, but you don't tell anyoneThat you might not be the golden oneAnd you're tied together with a smileBut you're coming undoneI guess it's true that love was all you wantedCause you're giving it away like it's extra changeHoping it will end up in his pocketBut he leaves you out like a penny in the rainOh, cause it's not his price to payNot his price to pay...[Chorus x2]You're tied together with a smileBut you're coming undone... ohGoodbye, babyWith a smile, baby, babyCory's eyes are like a jungleHe smiles, it's like the radioHe whispers songs into my windowIn words that nobody knowsThere's pretty girls on every cornerThat watch him as he's walking homeSaying, "Does he know?"Will you ever know?[Chorus:]You're beautifulEvery little piece love,And don't you knowYou're really gonna be someone,Ask anyone.And when you find everything you looked forI hope your life lead you back to my doorOh, but if it don't,Stay beautifulCory finds another way to beThe highlight of my dayI'm taking pictures in my mindSo I can save them for a rainy dayIt's hard to make a conversationWhen he's taking my breath awayI should say, hey, by the way...[Chorus]If you and I are a storyThat never gets toldIf what you are is a daydreamI'll never get to hold,At least you'll know...You're beautifulEvery little piece love,And don't you knowYou're really gonna be someone,Ask anyone.And when you find everything you looked for,I hope your life lead you back to my front door.Oh, but if it don'tWill you stayBeautiful, beautiful, beautifulBeautiful, beautiful, beautifulLa la laOh, oh, oh, oh,Oh, but if it don't,Stay beautifulStay beautifulNa, na, na, na, naIt's strange to think the songs we used to singThe smiles, the flowers, everything is goneYesterday I found out about youEven now just looking at you feels wrongYou say that you'd take it all back, given one chanceIt was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."[Chorus:]You should've said "No", you should've gone homeYou should've thought twice 'fore you let it all goYou should've known that word, with what you did with her,Get back to me (get back to me).And I should've been there in the back of your mindI shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have meYou can see that I've been cryingBaby, you know all the right things to sayBut do you honestly expect me to believeWe could ever be the same?You say that the past is the past, you need one chanceIt was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."[Chorus]I can't resistBefore you go, tell me this:Was it worth it?Was she worth this?No... no, no, no...[Chorus]She said, I was seven and you were nineI looked at you like the stars that shinedIn the sky, the pretty lightsAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of usGrowing up and falling in love and our mamas smiledAnd rolled their eyes and said oh my my myTake me back to the house in the backyard treeSaid you'd beat me up, you were bigger than meYou never did, you never didTake me back when our world was one block wideI dared you to kiss me and ran when you triedJust two kids, you and I...Oh my my my myWell, I was sixteen when suddenlyI wasn't that little girl you used to seeBut your eyes still shined like pretty lightsAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of usThey never believed we'd really fall in loveAnd our mamas smiled and rolled their eyesAnd said oh my my my...Take me back to the creek beds we turned upTwo A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to meTake me back to the time we had our very first fightThe slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnightYou stayed outside till the morning lightOh my my my myA few years had gone and come aroundWe were sitting at our favorite spot in townAnd you looked at me, got down on one kneeTake me back to the time when we walked down the aisleOur whole town came and our mamas criedYou said I do and I did tooTake me home where we met so many years beforeWe'll rock our babies on that very front porchAfter all this time, you and II'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nineI'll still look at you like the stars that shineIn the sky, oh my my my...I was riding shotgunWith my hair undoneIn the front seat of his carHe's got a one-hand feelOn the steering wheelThe other on my heartI look around, turn the radio downHe says, "Baby is something wrong?"I say, "Nothing,I was just thinkingHow we don't have a song"And he says...[Chorus:]Our song is the slamming screen door,Sneakin' out late, tapping on your windowWhen we're on the phone and you talk real slow'cause it's late and your mama don't knowOur song is the way you laughThe first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"And when I got home ... 'fore I said amenAsking God if he could play it againI was walking upThe front porch stepsAfter everything that dayHad gone all wrongAnd been trampled onAnd lost and thrown awayGot to the hallway,Well on my wayTo my lovin' bedI almost didn't noticeAll the rosesAnd the note that said...[Chorus:]Our song is the slamming screen door,Sneakin' out late, tapping on your windowWhen we're on the phone and you talk real slow'cause it's late and your mama don't knowOur song is the way you laughThe first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"And when I got home ... 'fore I said amenAsking God if he could play it againI've heard every album, listened to the radioWaited for something to come alongThat was as good as our song...[Chorus:]'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,Sneakin' out late, tapping on his windowWhen we're on the phone and he talks real slow'cause it's late and his mama don't knowOur song is the way he laughsThe first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have"And when I got home ... 'fore I said amenAsking God if he could play it againPlay it againOh, yeah...Oh-oh, yeah.I was riding shotgunWith my hair undoneIn the front seat of his carI grabbed a penAnd an old napkinAnd I wrote down our songFriday night beneath the stars,in a field behind your yard,you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.And sometimes we don't say a thing;just listen to the crickets sing.Everything I need is right here by my side.And I know everything about youI don't wanna live without you.[Chorus:]I'm only up when you're not down.Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.It's like no matter what I do.Well you drive me crazy half the time;the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.And I'm only me when I'm with you.Just a small town boy and girllivin' in a crazy world.Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.And I don't try to hide my tears.The secrets or my deepest fears.Through it all nobody gets me like you do.And you know everything about me.You say that you can't live without me.[Chorus]When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.Only you can tell.[Chorus:]That I'm only up when you're not down.Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.It's like no matter what I do.Well you drive me crazy half the time;the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.And I'm only meWho I wanna beWell, I'm only me when I'm with youWith youUh huhYeahShe cant see the way your eyesLight up when you smile.Shell never notice how you stop and stareWhenever she walks by.And you cant see me wantin' you the way you want herBut you are everything to me.[Chorus:]I just wanna show youShe dont even know you,She's never gonna love you like I want to.And you just see right through me.If you only knew meWe could be a beautifulMiracle,UnbelievableInstead of just invisible.Theres a fire inside of youThat cant help but shine through.Shes never gonna see the lightNo matter what you do.And all I think about is how to make you think of meAnd everything that we could be[Chorus]Like shadows in a faded lightOh, were invisible.I just wanna open your eyesAnd make you realize.I just wanna show youShe dont even know you.Baby, let me love you,Let me want you.You just see right through meBut if you only knew meWe could be a beautifulMiracle,UnbelievableInstead of just invisible.She cant see the way your eyesLight up when you smile.[Chorus 1:]Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?Why would you wanna make the very first scar?Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.No matter what you say, I still can't believeThat you would walk away.It don't make sense to me, but:[Repeat Chorus 1:]Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?Why would you wanna make the very first scar?Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?It's not unbroken anymore.How do I get it back the way it was before?[Chorus 2:]Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?Why would you wanna make the very first scar?Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:[Repeat Chorus 1:]Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?Why would you wanna make the very first scar?Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?Last Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day, you gave it awayThis year, to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialOnce bitten and twice shiedI keep my distance but you still catch my eyeTell me babyDo you recognize meWell, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise meMerry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent itWith a note saying 'I love you', I meant itNow I know what a fool I've beenBut if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me againLast Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day, you gave it awayThis year, to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialLast Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day, you gave it awayThis year, to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialA crowded room and friends with tired eyesI'm hiding from you and your soul of iceMy God, I thought you were someone to rely onMe, I guess I was a shoulder to cry onA face on a lover with a fire in his heartA girl on a cover but you tore her apartMaybe this yearMaybe this year I'll give it to someone specialCause last Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day, you gave it awayThis year, to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialLast Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day, you gave it awayThis year, to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialAnd last ChristmasAnd this yearIt won't be anything like, anything likeLast Christmas I gave you my heartBut the very next day, you gave it awayThis year, to save me from tearsI'll give it to someone specialPlease take down the misletoeCause I don't wanna think about that right nowCause everything I want is miles awayIn a snow covered little townMy momma's in the kitchen, worrying about meSeason's greetings, hope you're wellWell I'm doing alrightIf you were wonderingLately I can never tellI know this shouldn't be a lonely timeBut there were Christmases when you were mineI've been doing fine without you, reallyUp until the nights got coldAnd everybody's here, except you, babySeems like everyone's got someone to holdBut for me it's just a lonely timeCause there were Christmases when you were mineMerry Christmas everybodyThat'll have to be something I just say this yearI'll bet you got your mom another sweaterAnd were your cousins late againWhen you were putting up the lights this yearDid you notice one less pair of handsI know this shouldn't be a lonely timeBut there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonightCause there were Christmases when you were mineYou were mineSanta baby, slip a sable under the tree, for meI've been an awful good girl, santa babySo hurry down the chimney tonightSanta baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blueWell I'll wait up for you, dear, santa babySo hurry down the chimney tonight, yeahThink of all the fun I've missedThink of all the boys I haven't kissedNext year I could be just as goodIf you check off my Christmas listSanta baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lotI've been an angel all year, santa babySo hurry down the chimney tonightSanta, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deedTo a platinum mine, santa honeySo hurry down the chimney tonightCome and trim my Christmas treeWith some decorations bought at Tiffany'sI really do believe in youLet's see if you believe in meSanta baby, forgot to mention one little thingA ringAnd I don't mean on the phone, santa babySo hurry down the chimney tonightSilent night, holy nightAll is calm and all is brightRound yon virgin mother and childHoly infant so tender and mildSleep in heavenly peaceSleep in heavenly peaceSilent night, holy nightShepherds quake at the sightGlories stream from Heaven afarHeavenly hosts sing halleluiaChrist the savior is bornChrist our savior is bornSilent night, holy nightSon of GodLove's pure lightRadiant beams from thy holy faceWith the dawn of redeeming graceJesus Lord at thy birthJesus Lord at thy birthHalleluia!Halleluia!Halleluia!Christ the savior is bornWhat if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?Would the song still survive without five golden rings?Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?What would happen if God never let it snow?What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?Tell me what would you findYou'd see that today holds something specialSomething holy, not superficialSo here's to the birthday boy who saved our livesIt's something we all try to ignoreAnd put a wreath up on your doorSo here's something you should know that is for sureChristmas must be something moreWhat if angels did not pay attention toAll the things that we wished they would always do?What if happiness came in a cardboard box?Then I think there is something we all forgotWhat would happen if presents all went away?Tell me what would you findYou'd see that today holds something specialSomething holy, not superficialSo here's to the birthday boy who saved our livesIt's something we all try to ignoreAnd put a wreath up on your doorSo here's something you should know that is for sureChristmas must be something moreWe get so caught up in all of itBusiness and relationshipsHundred mile an hour livesAnd it's this time of yearAnd everybody's hereIt seems the last thing on your mindIs that the day holds something specialSomething holy, not superficial?So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our livesIt's something we all try to ignoreAnd put a wreath up on your doorBut here's something you should know that is for sureChristmas must be somethingChristmas must be somethingChristmas must be something moreThere's gotta be moreThere's gotta be moreI'm dreaming of a white ChristmasJust like the ones I used to knowWhere the tree tops glisten and children listenTo hear sleigh bells in the snowI'm dreaming of a white ChristmasWith every Christmas card I writeMay your days be merry and brightAnd

caught onto somethingI hold onto the nightYou looked me in the eye and told me you loved meWere you just kidding cause it seems to meThis thing is breaking down, we almost never speakI don't feel welcome anymoreBaby, what happened, please tell meCause one second it was perfectNow you're half way out the doorAnd I stare at the phoneHe still hasn't calledAnd then you feel so lowYou can't feel nothing at allAnd you flashback toWhen he said forever and alwaysOh, and it rains in your bedroomEverything is wrongIt rains when you're hereAnd it rains when you're goneI was there when you said forever and alwaysWas I out of line?Did I say something way too honest?Made you run and hide like a scared little boyI looked into your eyesThought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sureSo here's to everything coming down to nothingHere's to silence that cuts me to the coreWhere is this going?Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymoreAnd I stare at the phoneHe still hasn't calledAnd then you feel so lowYou can't feel nothing at allAnd you flashback toWhen he said forever and alwaysAnd it rains in your bedroomEverything is wrongIt rains when you're

nothing more right babeMisty morning comes again and I can'tHelp but wish I could see your faceAnd I knew from the first note playedI'd be breaking all my rules to see youYou smile that beautiful smile andAll the girls in the front row scream your nameSo dim that spotlight, tell me things likeI can't take my eyes off of youI'm no one special, just anotherWide eyed girl who's desperately in love with youGive me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstarGood morning loneliness, comes around when I'm notDreaming about youWhen my world wakes up todayYou'll be in another townAnd I knew when I saw your face, I'd beCounting down the ways to see youYou smile that beautiful smile andAll the girls in the front row scream your nameSo dim that spotlight, tell me things likeI can't take my eyes off of youI'm no one special, just anotherWide eyed girl who's desperately in love with youGive me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstarYou played in bars, you play guitarI'm invisible and everyone knows who you areAnd you'll never see, sing me to sleepEvery night from the radioSo dim that spotlight, tell me things likeI can't take my eyes off of youI'm no one special, just anotherWide eyed girl who's desperately in love with youGive me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstarSweet, sweet superstar, superstarIn the heat of the fight I walked awayIgnoring words that you were sayingTrying to make me stayI said, "This time I've had enough."And you've called a hundred timesBut I'm not picking up'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's overBut if you look a little closerI said, "Leave," but all I really want is youTo stand outside my window throwing pebblesScreaming, "I'm in love with you."Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for moreAnd don't you leave 'cause I knowAll I need is on the other side of the doorMe and my stupid pride are sitting here aloneGoing through the photographs, staring at the phoneI keep going back over things we both saidAnd I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misreadSo babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't seeWhen I left I wanted you to chase after meYeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is youTo stand outside my window throwing pebblesScreaming, "I'm in love with you."Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for moreAnd don't you leave 'cause I knowAll I need is on the other side of the doorAnd I'll scream out the windowI can't even look at youI don't need you but I do, I do, I doI say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again.I mean it, I mean it."What I mean is...I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is youTo stand outside my window throwing pebblesScreaming, "I'm in love with you."Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for moreAnd don't you leave 'cause I knowAll I need is on the other side of the doorWith your face and the beautiful eyesAnd the conversation with the little white liesAnd the faded picture of a beautiful nightYou carry me from your car up the stairsAnd I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?After everything and that little black dressAfter everything I must confess, I need youThere's somethin' 'bout the wayThe street looks when it's just rainedThere's a glow off the pavementYou walk me to the carAnd you know I wanna ask you to dance right thereIn the middle of the parking lotYeahOh yeahWe're drivin' down the roadI wonder if you knowI'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up nowBut you're just so coolRun your hands through your hairAbsent-mindedly makin' me want youAnd I don't know how it gets better than thisYou take my hand and drag me head firstFearlessAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dressFearlessSo, baby, drive slow'Til we run out of road in this one horse townI wanna stay right here in this passenger's seatYou put your eyes on meIn this moment now capture it, remember it'Cause I don't know how it gets better than thisYou take my hand and drag me head firstFearlessAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dressFearlessWell, you stood there with me in the doorwayMy hands shakeI'm not usually this wayBut you pull me in and I'm a little more braveIt's the first kiss,It's flawless,Really something,It's fearless.Oh yeah'Cause I don't know how it gets better than thisYou take my hand and drag me head firstFearlessAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dressFearless'Cause I don't know how it gets better than thisYou take my hand and drag me head firstFearlessAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dressFearlessOh-ohOh yeahYou take a deep breath and you walk through the doorsIt's the morning of your very first dayYou say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a whileTry and stay out of everybody's wayIt's your freshman year and you're gonna be hereFor the next four years in this townHoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,"You know I haven't seen you around before."'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love youYou're gonna believe themAnd when you're fifteenFeeling like there's nothing to figure outWell count to ten, take it inThis is life before you know who you're gonna beFifteenYou sit in class next to a redhead named AbigailAnd soon enough you're best friendsLaughing at the other girls who think they're so coolWe'll be out of here as soon as we canAnd then you're on your very first date and he's got a carAnd you're feeling like flyingAnd you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the oneAnd you're dancing 'round your room when the night endsWhen the night ends'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love youYou're gonna believe themWhen you're fifteen and your first kissMakes your head spin round butIn your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football teamBut I didn't know it at fifteenWhen all you wanted was to be wantedWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know nowBack then I swore I was gonna marry him somedayBut I realized some bigger dreams of mineAnd Abigail gave everything she had to a boyWho changed his mind and we both cried'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love youYou're gonna believe themAnd when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fallI've found that time can heal most anythingAnd you just might find who you're supposed to beI didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteenLa la la la la la laLa la la la la la laLa la la la la la laYour very first dayTake a deep breath, girlTake a deep breath as you walk through the doors.We were both young when I first saw you.I close my eyes and the flashback starts:I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.See you make your way through the crowdAnd say, "Hello, "Little did I know...That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"And I was crying on the staircaseBegging you, "Please don't go"And I said...Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".So I sneak out to the garden to see you.We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knewSo close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.Oh, oh.'Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"But you were everything to me,I was begging you, "Please don't go"And I said...Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.This love is difficult but it's real.Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".Oh, oh, oh.I got tired of waitingWondering if you were ever coming around.My faith in you was fadingWhen I met you on the outskirts of town.And I said...Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone.I keep waiting for you but you never come.Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.I love you, and that's all I really know.I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dressIt's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.'Cause we were both young when I first saw youHey Stephen,I know looks can be deceivingBut I know I saw a light in you.And as we walkedWe were talking I didn't say half the things I wanted to.Of all the girls tossing rocks at your windowI'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.Hey Stephen,Boy, you might have me believingI don't always have to be alone.[Chorus:]'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.Can't help it if there's no one else.Mmm, I can't help myself.Hey Stephen,I've been holding back this feeling.So I've got some things to say to you, ha.I seen it all So I thought But I never seen nobody shine the way you do.The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.Hey Stephen,Why are people always leaving?I think you and I should stay the same.[Chorus]They're dimming the street lights.You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.Hey Stephen,I could give you fifty reasonsWhy I should be the one you choose.All those other girls Well, they're beautifulBut would they write a song for you?[Chorus:]I can't help it if you look like an angel,Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.Can't help it if there's no one else.Mmm, I can't help myself......if you look like an angel.Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.Can't help it if there's no one else.Mmm, I can't help myself.Myself,Can't help myself,I can't help myself.Say you're sorryThat face of an angelComes out just when you need it toAs I paced back and forth all this time'Cause I honestly believed in youHolding onThe days drag onStupid girl,I should have known, I should have known[Chorus:]That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,Lead her up the stairwellThis ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come aroundMaybe I was naive,Got lost in your eyesAnd never really had a chanceMy mistake, I didn't know to be in loveYou had to fight to have the upper handI had so many dreamsAbout you and meHappy endingsNow I know[Chorus:]That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,Lead her up the stairwellThis ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come aroundAnd there you are on your knees,Begging for forgiveness, begging for meJust like I always wanted but I'm so sorry'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me wellThis is a big world, that was a small townThey're in my rear view mirror disappearing nowAnd it's too late for you and your white horseNow it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me nowOh, whoa, whoa, whoaTry and catch me nowOh, it's too lateTo catch me nowYou're on the phone with your girlfriendShe's upset, she's going off about something that you said'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.And she'll never know your story like I do.But she wears short skirtsI wear t-shirtsShe's cheer captainAnd I'm on the bleachersDreaming about the day when you wake up and findThat what you're looking for has been here the whole time.If you could seeThat I'm the oneWho understands you.Been here all along.So, why can't you seeYou belong with me,You belong with me.Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeansI can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,"Hey, isn't this easy?"And you've got a smileThat could light up this whole town.I haven't seen it in a whileSince she brought you down.You say you're fine I know you better than that.Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?She wears high heels,I wear sneakers.She's cheer captain,And I'm on the bleachers.Dreaming about the day when you wake up and findThat what you're looking for has been here the whole time.If you could seeThat I'm the oneWho understands you,Been here all along.So, why can't you seeYou belong with me.Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.All this time how could you not know, baby?You belong with me,You belong with me.[Instrumental]Oh, I remember you driving to my houseIn the middle of the night.I'm the one who makes you laughWhen you know you're 'bout to cry.I know your favorite songs,And you tell me about your dreams.Think I know where you belong,Think I know it's with me.Can't you seeThat I'm the oneWho understands you?Been here all along.So, why can't you seeYou belong with me.Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.All this time how could you not know, baby?You belong with me,You belong with me.You belong with me.Have you ever thought just maybeYou belong with me?You belong with me.I see your face in my mind as I drive away,Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.Mmm mmm mmmMmm mmm mmm mmm mmmMmm mmm mmmMmm mmm mmm mmm mmmMusic starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,Now I don't know what to be without you around.And we know it's never simple, never easy.Never a clean break, no one here to save me.You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,And I can't breathe without youBut I have to.Breathe without youBut I have to.Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.And we know it's never simple, never easy.Never a clean break, no one here to save me.You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,And I can't breathe without youBut I have to.Breathe without youBut I have to.It's two A.M.Feelin' like I just lost a friend.Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.It's two A.M.Feelin' like I just lost a friend.Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.And we know it's never simple, never easy.Never a clean break, no one here to save me.OhhhAnd I can't breathe without youBut I have to.Breathe without youBut I have to.Breathe without youBut I have to.I'm sorry (oh)I'm sorry (mmm)I'm sorry (eh eh)I'm sorry (mmm)I'm sorry (eh eh)I'm sorry (mmm)I'm sorryI took a chance, I took a shot And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not You took a swing, I took it hard And down here from the ground I see who you are I'm sick and tired of your attitude I'm feeling like I don't know you You tell me that you love me then you cut me down And I need you like a heartbeat But you know you got a mean streak Makes me run for cover when you're around And here's to you and your temper Yes, I

Forget what i'm trying to say, oh I'm sick and tired of your reasons I got no one to believe in You tell me that you want me, then push me around And I need you like a heartbeat But you know you got a mean streak Makes me run for cover when you're around Here's to you and your temper Yes, I remember what you said last night And I know that you see what you're doing to me Tell me why.. Why..do you have to make me feel small So you can feel whole inside Why..do you have to put down my dreams So you're the only thing on my mind I'm sick and tired of your attitude I'm feeling like I don't know you You tell me that you want me then cut me down I'm sick and tired of your reasons I've got no one to believe in You ask me for my love then you push me around Here's to you and your temper Yes, I remember what you said last night And I know that you see what you're doing to me Tell me why Why, tell me why I take a step back, let you go I told you i'm not bulletproof Now you knowAll this time I was wasting,Hoping you would come aroundI've been giving out chances every timeAnd all you do is let me downAnd it's taken me this longBaby but I figured you outAnd you're thinking we'll be fine again,But not this time aroundYou don't have to call anymoreI won't pick up the phoneThis is the last strawDon't wanna hurt anymoreAnd you can tell me that you're sorryBut I don't believe you babyLike I did beforeYou're not sorry, no no ohLooking so innocent,I might believe you if I didn't knowCould've loved you all my lifeIf you hadn't left me waiting in the coldAnd you got your share of secretsAnd I'm tired of being last to knowAnd now you're asking me to listenCause it's worked each time beforeBut you don't have to call anymoreI

ohHe is sensible and so incredible And all my single friends are jealous He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better He opens up my door and I get into his car And he says you look beautiful tonight And I feel perfectly fine But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name You're so in love that you act insane And that's the way I loved you Breakin' down and coming undone It's a roller coaster kinda rush And I never knew I could feel that much And that's the way I loved you He respects my space And never makes me wait And he calls exactly when he says he will He's close to my mother Talks business with my father He's charming and endearing And I'm comfortable But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name You're so in love that you act insane And that's the way I loved you Breakin' down and coming undone It's a roller coaster kinda rush And I never knew I could feel that much And that's the way I loved you He can't see the smile I'm faking And my heart's not breaking Cause I'm not feeling anything at all And you were wild and crazy Just so frustrating intoxicating Complicated, got away by some mistake and now I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain It's 2am and I'm cursing your name I'm so in love that I acted insane And that's the way I loved you Breaking down and coming undone It's a roller coaster kinda rush And I never knew I could feel that much And that's the way I loved you oh, oh And that's the way I loved you oh, oh Never knew I could feel that much And that's the way I loved youOnce upon a time,I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eyeAnd we caught onto somethingI hold onto the night,You looked me in the eyeAnd told me you loved meWere you just kidding?'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking downWe almost never speakI don't feel welcome anymoreBaby, what happened, please tell me?'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the doorAnd I stare at the phone,He still hasn't calledAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at allAnd you flashback to when he said forever and alwaysOh, and it rains in your bedroomEverything is wrongIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone'Cause I was there when you said forever and alwaysWas I out of line?Did I say something way too honest?Made you run and hideLike a scared little boy?I looked into your eyesThought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sureSo here's to everythingComing down to nothingHere's to silenceThat cuts me to the coreWhere is this going?Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymoreAnd I stare at the phone,He still hasn't calledAnd then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at allAnd you flashback to when he said forever and alwaysOh, and it rains in your bedroomEverything is wrongIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone'Cause I was there when you said forever and alwaysYou didn't mean it, baby,I don't think soBack up, baby, back upDid you forget everything?Back up, baby, back upDid you forget everything?'Cause it rains in your bedroomEverything is wrongIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone'Cause I was there when you said forever and alwaysOh, I stare at the phone,He still hasn't calledAnd then you feel so lowYou can't feel nothing at allAnd you flashback to when we said forever and alwaysAnd it rains in your bedroomEverything is wrongIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone'Cause I was there when you said forever and alwaysYou didn't mean it, baby,You said forever and always... yeahI'm five years oldIt's getting coldI've got my big coat onI hear your laughAnd look up smiling at youI run and runPast the pumpkin patchAnd the tractor ridesLook now -- the sky is goldI hug your legs and fall asleepOn the way homeI don't know why all the trees change in the fallI know you're not scared of anything at allDon't know if Snow White's house is near or far awayBut I know I had the best dayWith you todayI'm thirteen nowAnd don't know how my friendsCould be so meanI come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keysAnd we drive and driveUntil we've found a townFar enough awayAnd we talk and window-shopUntil I've forgotten all their namesI don't know who I'm gonna talk toNow at schoolI know I'm laughing on the car ride home with youDon't know how long it's gonna take to feel okayBut I know I had the best dayWith you todayI have an excellent fatherHis strength is making me strongerGod smiles on my little brotherInside and outHe's better than I amI grew up in a pretty houseAnd I had space to runAnd I had the best days with youThere is a videoI found from back when I was threeYou set up a paint set in the kitchenAnd you're talking to meIt's the age of princesses and pirate shipsAnd the seven dwarfsDaddy's smartAnd you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide worldNow I know why all the trees change in the fallI know you were on my sideEven when I was wrongAnd I love you for giving me your eyesStaying back and watching me shineAnd I didn't know if you knewSo I'm taking this chance to sayThat I had the best dayWith you todayAnd its a sad picture,The final blow hits youSomebody else gets what you wanted againAnd you know its all the same,Another time and placeRepeating history and youre getting sick of itBut I believe in whatever you doAnd Ill do anything to see it throughBecause these things will changeCan you feel it now?These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall downThis revolution, the time will comeFor us to finally winAnd well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujahSo weve been outnumberedRaided and now corneredIts hard to fight when the fight aint fairWere getting stronger nowFind things they never foundThey might be biggerBut were faster and never scaredYou can walk away, say we dont need thisBut theres something in your eyes says we can beat this'Cause these things will changeCan you feel it now?These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall downThis revolution, the time will comeFor us to finally winAnd well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujahTonight we'll stand, get off our kneesFight for what weve worked for all these yearsAnd the battle was long, its the fight of our livesBut well stand up champions tonightIt was the night things changedCan you see it now?These walls that they put up to hold us back fell downThis revolution, throw your hands up'Cause we never gave inAnd we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujahHallelujahUh, oh, ohUh, oh, ohYou were in college working part time waiting tablesLeft a small town, never looked backI was a flight risk with a fear of fallinWondering why we bother with love if it never lastsI say, "Can you believe it?"As were lying on the couchThe moment I can see it.Yes, yes, I can see it now.Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?You put your arm around me for the first time.You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter.You are the best thing thats ever been mine.Flash forward and were taking on the world together,And theres a drawer of my things at your place.You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded,You say well never make my parents mistakes.But we got bills to pay,We got nothing figured out,When it was hard to take,Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?You put your arm around me for the first timeYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughterYou are the best thing thats ever been mine.Do you remember all the city lights on the water?You saw me start to believe for the first timeYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughterYou are the best thing thats ever been mine.Oh, oh, oh, ohAnd I remember that fightTwo-thirty AMAs everything was slipping right out of our handsI ran out crying and you followed me out into the streetBraced myself for the "Goodbye."Cause thats all Ive ever knownThen you took me by surpriseYou said, "Ill never leave you alone."You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water.And every time I look at you, its like the first time.I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter.She is the best thing thats ever been mine."Hold on, make it lastHold on, never turn backYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughterYou are the best thing thats ever been mine.(Hold on) do you believe it?(Hold on) we're gonna make it now.(Hold on) and I can see it,(Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...)The way you move is like a full-on rainstormAnd I'm a house of cardsYou're the kind of recklessThat should send me runnin'But I kinda know that I won't get farAnd you stood there in front of meJust close enough to touchClose enough to hope you couldn't seeWhat I was thinking ofDrop everything nowMeet me in the pouring rainKiss me on the sidewalkTake away the pain'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smileGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go downGive me something that'll haunt me when you're not around'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smileMy mind forgets to remind meYou're a bad ideaYou touch me once and it's really something,You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.I'm on my guard for the rest of the worldBut with you I know it's no goodAnd I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...Drop everything nowMeet me in the pouring rainKiss me on the sidewalkTake away the pain'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smileGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go downGive me something that'll haunt me when you're not around'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smileI'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.And lead me up the staircaseWon't you whisper soft and slow?I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.Drop everything now,Meet me in the pouring rain,Kiss me on the sidewalk,Take away the pain'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go downGive me something that'll haunt me when you're not around'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smileAnd the sparks fly...Oh, baby, smile...And the sparks fly...I'm so glad you made time to see me.How's life? Tell me how's your family?I haven't seen them in a while.You've been good, busier than ever,We small talk, work and the weather,Your guard is up and I know why.Because the last time you saw meIs still burned in the back of your mind.You gave me roses and I left them there to die.So this is me swallowing my pride,Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"And I go back to December all the time.It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.I go back to December all the time.These days I haven't been sleeping,Staying up, playing back myself leavin'.When your birthday passed and I didn't call.And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,I watched you laughing from the passenger side.Realized I loved you in the fall.And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mindYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".So this is me swallowing my prideStanding in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."And I go back to December all the time.It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mindI go back to December all the time.I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile,So good to me, so rightAnd how you held me in your arms that September nightThe first time you ever saw me cry.Maybe this is wishful thinking,Probably mindless dreaming,But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.So if the chain is on your door I understand.But this is me swallowing my prideStanding in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."And I go back to December...It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mindI go back to December all the time.All the time.I am not the kind of girlWho should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasionBut you are not the kind of boyWho should be marrying the wrong girlI sneak in and see your friendsAnd her snotty little family all dressed in pastelAnd she is yelling at a bridesmaidSomewhere back inside a roomWearing a gown shaped like a pastryThis is surely not what you thought it would beI lose myself in a daydreamWhere I stand and say[Chorus:]Dont say "Yes", run away nowIll meet you when youre out of the church at the back doorDont wait or say a single vowYou need to hear me outAnd they said, "Speak now."Fond gestures are exchangedAnd the organ starts to playA song that sounds like a death marchAnd I am hiding in the curtainsIt seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-beShe floats down the aisle like a pageant queenBut I know you wish it was me,You wish it was me,Dont you?[Chorus:]Dont say "Yes", run away now,Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.Dont wait or say a single vow,You need to hear me out,And they said, "Speak now."Dont say "Yes", run away now,Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.Dont wait or say a single vow,Your time is running out,And they said, "Speak now."Oh, la, laOh, ohSay a single vowI hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."Theres the silence, theres my last chance.I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.Horrified looks from everyone in the roomBut Im only looking at you.I am not the kind of girlWho should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasionBut you are not the kind of boyWho should be marrying the wrong girl[Chorus:]So, dont say "Yes", run away now,Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.Dont wait or say a single vow,You need to hear me out,And they said, "Speak now."And you say, "Lets run away now,Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door.Baby, I didnt say my vows,So glad you were aroundWhen they said, "Speak now."Long were the nights whenMy days once revolved around youCounting my footstepsPraying the floor wont fall through, againAnd my mother accused me of losing my mindBut I swore I was fineYou paint me a blue skyAnd go back and turn it to rainAnd I lived in your chess gameBut you changed the rules everydayWonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonightWell I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know whyDear John, I see it all now that you're gone.Don't you think I was too youngTo be messed with?The girl in the dressCried the whole way home, I should've known.Well maybe its meAnd my blind optimism to blameOr maybe its you and your sick needTo give love then take it awayAnd you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understandAnd I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said,"Run as fast as you can."Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.Don't you think I was too youngTo be messed with?The girl in the dressCried the whole way homeDear John, I see it all now it was wrongDont you think nineteens too youngTo be played by your dark, twisted games?When I loved you so, I should've known.You are an expert at "Sorry"And keeping lines blurryNever impressed by me acing your testsAll the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyesCause you've burned them outBut I took your matchesBefore fire could catch meSo dont look nowIm shining like fireworksOver your sad empty townDear John, I see it all now that you're gone.Don't you think I was too youngTo be messed with?The girl in the dressCried the whole way homeI see it all now that you're goneDon't you think I was too youngTo be messed with?The girl in the dressWrote you a song, you shouldve known.You shouldve knownDont you think I was too young?You shouldve known.You, with your words like knivesAnd swords and weapons that you use against meYou have knocked me off my feet againGot me feeling like a nothingYou, with your voice like nails on a chalkboardCalling me out when I'm woundedYou, picking on the weaker manWell you can take me down with just one single blowBut you don't know, what you don't know...Someday I'll be living in a big ole cityAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit meAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanWhy you gotta be so mean?You, with your switching sidesAnd your wildfire lies and your humiliationYou have pointed out my flaws againAs if I don't already see themI walk with my head downTrying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress youI just wanna feel okay againI bet you got pushed aroundSomebody made you coldBut the cycle ends right now'Cause you can't lead me down that roadAnd you don't know, what you don't know...Someday I'll be living in a big ole cityAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit meAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanWhy you gotta be so mean?And I can see you years from now in a barTalking over a football gameWith that same big loud opinionBut nobody's listeningWashed up and ranting about the same old bitter thingsDrunk and grumbling on about how I can't singBut all you are is meanAll you are is meanAnd a liar, and pathetic, and alone in lifeAnd mean, and mean, and mean, and meanBut someday I'll be living in a big ole cityAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeahSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit meAnd all you're ever gonna be is meanWhy you gotta be so?...Someday I'll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...)And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)And all you're ever gonna be is meanWhy you gotta be so mean?I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,How we met and the sparks flew instantly,and people would say, "They're the lucky ones."I used to know my place was the spot next to you,Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.Oh, a simple complication,Miscommunications lead to fall-out.So many things that I wish you knew,So many walls up I can't break through.[Chorus:]Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.Next chapter.How'd we end up this way?See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,And you're doing your best to avoid me.I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,But you held your pride like you should've held me.Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,Why are we pretending this is nothing?I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how,I've never heard silence quite this loud.[Chorus:]Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.This is looking like a contest,Of who can act like they care less,But I liked it better when you were on my side.The battle's in your hands now,But I would lay my armor downIf you said you'd rather love than fight.So many things that you wish I knew,But the story of us might be ending soon.[Chorus:]Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.And we're not speaking,And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.The end.Your little hand's wrapped around my fingerAnd it's so quiet in the world tonightYour little eyelids flutter cause you're dreamingSo I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night lightTo you everything's funny, you got nothing to regretI'd give all I have, honeyIf you could stay like thatOh darling, don't you ever grow upDon't you ever grow up, just stay this littleOh darling, don't you ever grow upDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this simpleI won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heartAnd no one will desert youJust try to never grow up, never grow upYou're in the car on the way to the moviesAnd you're mortified your mom's dropping you offAt 14 there's just so much you can't doAnd you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shotsBut don't make her drop you off around the blockRemember that she's getting older tooAnd don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for schoolOh darling, don't you ever grow upDon't you ever grow up, just stay this littleOh darling, don't you ever grow upDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this simpleNo one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarredAnd even though you want to, just try to never grow upTake pictures in your mind of your childhood roomMemorize what it sounded like when your dad gets homeRemember the footsteps, remember the words saidAnd all your little brother's favorite songsI just realized everything I have is someday gonna be goneSo here I am in my new apartmentIn a big city, they just dropped me offIt's so much colder than I thought it would beSo I tuck myself in and turn my night light onWish I'd never grown upI wish I'd never grown upOh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown upI could still be littleOh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown upIt could still be simpleOh darling, don't you ever grow upDon't you ever grow up, just stay this littleOh darling, don't you ever grow upDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this simpleWon't let nobody hurt youWon't let no one break your heartAnd even though you want to, please try to never grow upOh, don't you ever grow upOh, never grow up, just never grow upThere I was again tonightForcing laughter, faking smilesSame old tired lonely placeWalls of insincerity,Shifting eyes and vacancyVanished when I saw your faceAll I can say is it was enchanting to meet youYour eyes whispered, "Have we met?"Across the room your silhouetteStarts to make its way to meThe playful conversation startsCounter all your quick remarksLike passing notes in secrecyAnd it was enchanting to meet youAll I can say is I was enchanted to meet youThis night is sparkling, don't you let it goI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way homeI'll spend forever wondering if you knewI was enchanted to meet youThe lingering question kept me up2 AM, who do you love?I wonder 'til I'm wide awakeAnd now I'm pacing back and forthWishing you were at my doorI'd open up and you would say, "Hey,It was enchanting to meet you,All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."This night is sparkling, don't you let it goI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way homeI'll spend forever wondering if you knewThis night is flawless, don't you let it goI'm wonderstruck, dancing around all aloneI'll spend forever wondering if you knewI was enchanted to meet youThis is me praying thatThis was the very first pageNot where the story line endsMy thoughts will echo your nameUntil I see you againThese are the words I held backAs I was leaving too soonI was enchanted to meet youPlease don't be in love with someone elsePlease don't have somebody waiting on youPlease don't be in love with someone elsePlease don't have somebody waiting on youThis night is sparkling, don't you let it goI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way homeI'll spend forever wondering if you knewThis night is flawless, don't you let it goI'm wonderstruck, dancing around all aloneI'll spend forever wondering if you knewI was enchanted to meet youPlease don't be in love with someone elsePlease don't have somebody waiting on you"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did"Ha!Time for a little revengeThe story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted himShe came along, got him alone and let's hear the applauseShe took him faster than you could say "sabotage"I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected itI underestimated just who I was dealing withShe had to know the pain was beating on me like a drumShe underestimated just who she was stealing fromShe's not a saintAnd she's not what you thinkShe's an actress, whoaShe's better knownFor the things that she doesOn the mattress, whoaSoon she's gonna findStealing other people's toysOn the playground won'tMake you many friendsShe should keep in mindShe should keep in mindThere is nothing I do better than revengeShe looks at life like it's a party and she's on the listShe looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over itI think her ever-present frown is a little troublingAnd she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with thingsBut sophistication isn't what you wear or who you knowOr pushing people down to get you where you wanna goThey wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to meBut no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignityShe's not a saintAnd she's not what you thinkShe's an actress, whoaShe's better knownFor the things that she doesOn the mattress, whoaSoon she's gonna findStealing other people's toysOn the playground won'tMake you many friendsShe should keep in mindShe should keep in mindThere is nothing I do better than revengeI'm just another thing for youTo roll your eyes at, honeyYou might have him but haven't you heardI'm just another thing for youTo roll your eyes at, honeyYou might have him but I always get the last wordWhoaShe's not a saintAnd she's not what you thinkShe's an actress, whoaShe's better knownFor the things that she doesOn the mattress, whoaSoon she's gonna findStealing other people's toysOn the playground won'tMake you many friendsShe should keep in mindShe should keep in mindThere is nothing I do better than revenge
